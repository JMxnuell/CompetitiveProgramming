# CompetitiveProgramming
Repository for competitive programming practices

In this repository I will include algorithms, data structures and usual problems in competitive programming

The following handbook is taken as the basis of study:
<a href="https://cpbook.net/details?cp=4">Competitive Programming 4<a>

Therefore I will perform problems taken from:
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://codeforces.com/">CODEFORCES<a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cpbook.net/methodstosolve">Methods to Solve(CP4)<a></li>
</ol>
